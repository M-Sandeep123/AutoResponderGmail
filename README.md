# AutoResponderGmail

AutoResponderGmail is a Node.js application that automatically replies to new Gmail emails when the user is away. It detects unread, unreplied emails, sends preset replies, labels, and moves them to the inbox category. The application operates randomly every 45-120 seconds for efficient management.

## Libraries and Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js used to build the server.

- **OAuth2**: Authentication protocol used for accessing Gmail APIs securely.
- **JavaScript**: Language used for scripting and implementing the logic.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling throughout the code to provide detailed error messages and improve debugging capabilities.
2. **Code Refactoring**: Optimize code structure and modularize functions for better readability and maintainability.
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune the application to improve performance, especially during email detection and handling.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging mechanisms to monitor application behavior and track actions performed.
